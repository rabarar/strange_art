Luxor-inspired strange art in Julia

## Generate cool random strange art using Julia and [Lexor](https://github.com/JuliaGraphics/Luxor.jl)

This is a derivative work from the Luxor strange example. To run, first edit the makestrange.jl file and fiddle with the parameters. Then
run the program from the command line. The output is n files sequentially numbered along with a control file that stores the parameters for the
generated image. Have fun!

```
$ julia makestrange.jl
